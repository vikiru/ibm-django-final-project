<h1 align="center"> IBM Full Stack Software Developer Certificate <br> Django Application Development with SQL and Databases </h1>

## Online Course App

This is the final project within the course, "Django Application Development with SQL and Databases" in the IBM Full Stack Software Developer Certificate. The objective of this project is to implement a new course assessment feature to an existing course application by designing and developing the necessary models, templates, and views. Once this has been completed, the application will be thoroughly tested to ensure functionality is as expected.

More information about the course can be found [here](https://www.coursera.org/learn/developing-applications-with-sql-databases-and-django/).

## General Notes

An `onlinecourse` app has already been provided in this repo upon which you will be adding a new assesement feature.

- If you want to develop the final project on Theia hosted by [IBM Developer Skills Network](https://labs.cognitiveclass.ai/), you will need to create the same project structure on Theia workspace and save it everytime you close the browser
- Or you could develop the final project locally by setting up your own Python runtime and IDE
- Hints for the final project are left on source code files
- You may choose any cloud platform for deployment (default is IBM Cloud Foundry)
- Depends on your deployment, you may choose any SQL database Django supported such as SQLite3, PostgreSQL, and MySQL (default is SQLite3)

## ER Diagram
For your reference, we have prepared the ER diagram design for the new assesement feature.
